## Intro
This repo is the public version of a side project I'm working on. It is mostly a personal learning problem, applying skills learnt around extracting data from APIs and drawing insights from them.

### Spotify API script

[This python script](https://github.com/luckey01/spotify_api_random_track_generator/blob/main/get_spot_tracks_with_auth.py) can be used to generate a dataset of random track meta data from the [spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

Once you have [created your own app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/) you can enter your app ID and client secret into this script and run it from the command line.

I have posted a cleaned version of the output on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/luckey01/test-data-set).
